      <h1>The ASIC Statement: Clarification From The Bitcoin Nova Team</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img  src="../images/blog/asic-clarification.png" alt="asic-clarification-bitcoinnova"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Preamble</h3>
      <p>During the past few weeks we’ve seen many of the active discussions about mining and the increased hashrate. However, this discussion moves far away from a mining problem and becomes more of a political decision. We’ve decided to build a text in the following logic to shed some light on this important situation.</p>
      <h3>The role of the miners</h3>
      <p>A miner is typically a person who is combining business with pleasure. They support the ecosystem by maintaining the network’s health and generating new blocks on the blockchain. For these actions they get block rewards of algorithmically predetermined amounts. The miners are the main contributors in the network’s health as they are the most rational users on the chain. They weigh their costs and profit to find out which currency is the most profitable to mine at the current moment and with a particular setup.
      </p>
      <h3>The mining problem</h3>
      <p>Everything goes according to plan until the day when your project achieves some weight in the crypto world. Bitcoin Nova has rushed through all of the barriers in the history of crypto and has finally gained one of the most powerful communities and the support from many major opinion leaders. It’s a known fact that Bitcoin Nova has many competitors and every project is fighting against each other to prove its own legitimacy. This fight has no ethical nature and even your forks from yesterday may attack you tomorrow. The only thing that can save a system’s health is a strong network hashrate. In the case that you have heard of double spend, you have to understand that it’s only a matter of time for a weak network to be attacked by double spending. As a result, many stakeholders may be robbed, as well as most of the merchants and exchanges who won’t move to the new system.
      </p>
      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>Despite the fact that the Bitcoin Nova team is one of the biggest mysteries in the blockchain world, we do take care of our stakeholders. And our main goal is to protect the whole ecosystem from different kinds of attacks. Here they are:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Double spend attacks.</strong> It is our goal that these attacks never have the potential to happen and with the hasrate our network has now it is next to impossible to happen at all.<p>      
      <p><strong>51% attacks.</strong> This issue is about centralization of the mining powers, however, we&rsquo;re on the right path of being protected from this by supporting our local community-made pools. Thanks to the distribution of the hashrate across many different pools, Bitcoin Nova is thoroughly protected from 51% attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>e-anonymization.</strong> The last few weeks we’ve been blamed because of the fact that we have not followed Monero’s hardfork, however, we haven’t done this for one essential reason - the threat of de-anonymization of our users. You may have heard that right after Monero’s hardfork, at least 4 other forks have appeared. Every single Monero user who has used the new coins (XMO, XMC, XMZ, etc.) have automatically de-anonymized themselves because of the same key images. Even with what has happened with Monero, Bitcoin Nova still remains the anonymous cryptocurrency and we won’t let our users be de-anonymized. We’re proud to say that in the current market of anonymous currencies Bitcoin Nova has reinforced its position because some of Monero's users have now been compromised.
      </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img style="background: white;"  src="../images/blog/xmr-forks.png" alt="forks monero"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <h3>The Statement</h3>
      <p>Based on the above facts, Bitcoin Nova will support ASIC mining, at least until the end of 2018. We don’t have any right to open up our system and our users to attacks, as well as let our users be de-anonymized. The basic value of a coin is based on the PoW and its consensus’ ability to protect the ecosystem. In this case, ASIC miners are acting like protective agents in their ability to defend it. The Bitcoin Nova team would also like to acknowledge to our users that we’re coming to terms with different ways of how to continue supporting our small GPU miners. For those miners who are considering this process as one of the ways of earning, we would recommend to take a brief look at ASICs for three obvious reasons: they are at least twice cheaper than a regular GPU, they consume much less energy, and they give their users a lot more profit. In addition to this, the ASIC appearance in the Bitcoin Nova network seems to be one more proof of system maturity.
      </p>
      <h5>To summarize:</h5>      
      <ul>
      <li>Bitcoin Nova will continue supporting ASIC mining for obvious reasons: it protects the network from attacks.</li>
      
      <li>A fork in this case would de-anonymize our users which defeats the very purpose of an anonymous crypto coin.</li>
      
      <li>ASIC bans seem to be an unwise decision - the next generation of ASICs will include FPGA devices adjustable in just a few simple clicks, it’s only a matter of time.</li>
      
      <li>ASICs can’t be reviewed in a “positive-negative” dichotomy. It’s just a direct consequence of the technical progress that our information age continues to make (which is actually way more profitable than CPU and GPU mining).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In conclusion, we would like to remind our users of one fact: Bitcoin Nova is a project that was launched 1 years ago and will continue to be around long into the future. During this long period of time our team has seen how the crypto world has evolved. We’ve taken a major part in building this new era of the global crypto economy and have seen a lot of promising and doomed projects. We’ve faced an enormous amount of attacks and we’re still here thanks to a very simple reason: we think before we act, and keep in mind the consequences that may follow our decisions. We’re entering the very beginning of the age of financial privacy and we understand that in the future everything is going to be a great and continued success.

          <h6>What is Privacy and Why is It Important?</h6>
          <p>Let us raise a very tricky matter of privacy.</p>
          <p>Is privacy good or evil? Does any person have a right to be privacy-protected? Can we apply common statement "If you are doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide" to our lives?</p>
          <p>Right now, society is desperately looking for the answers to these particular questions, but it seems that government has solid position regarding them, too. Lack of privacy in our lives seems to be relatively farfetched problem for the majority of people, but eventually debates could turn into a serious confrontation. A careful eye would notice that for now there is little resistance.</p>
          <p>Look around thoroughly - we are living in the world where surveillance cameras are all around us, banks know exactly how much money we have and how exactly we are spending it, search engines know what exactly we are looking for and what exactly we like, and, of course, you should keep in mind that messages we send via social networks and messaging apps could be easily accessed by authorities.</p>
          <p>The year is 2015. Edward Snowden has already disclosed sensitive information concerning NSA surveillance techniques, and it does not look like the US citizens have a variety of rights when it comes down to privacy. His story has inspired some and terrified others.</p>
          <p>We voluntarily handed the government powers to enact all those laws as they told us that these were precautionary retaliations and it was done for the national safety and the safety of ourselves.</p>
          <p>Could it be that sometimes Government does not keep peoples' best interests at heart, being more concerned about its own footing?</p>

          <h6>WHAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY CAN DO AND WHAT COULD BE OVERSTRETCHED EXPECTATIONS</h6>
          <p>A lot is possible on the blockchain. But, the blockchain does not have power to solve every problem thrown at it.</p>
          <p>Diamond provenance protection, asset trading, land title registry, passport issuance, smart contracts, currency... you name it, there is already a startup building the solutions for it on the blockchain (the decentralized public ledger that underlines most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin). And the list of possible opportunities that the technology has to offer seems to grow longer each passing day.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact, it is now almost a given that at every Bitcoin meetup, conference or forum you attend, there will be someone who sees it as the right place to let the world know of the new blockchain innovation they have been working on. What's more, the impression that there is nothing that can't find a solution from the distributed ledger technology has done more than take hold in the Bitcoin community. It is now catching on with the mainstream financial institutions, technology companies and even beyond.</p>
